# Algorithmic Foundations — Notes

A collection of handwritten notes created while studying core data structures
and algorithms.

These notes focus on:
- problem decomposition
- recurrence relations
- time and space complexity
- algorithmic tradeoffs

Topics covered:
- Asymptotic analysis and recurrences
- Divide and Conquer algorithms
- Dynamic Programming
- Trees and heaps
- Hash tables and string hashing

These notes were written for personal understanding and long-term reference.
They are shared here for completeness and transparency of my learning process.
